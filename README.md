A VBA module that prompts the spreadsheet user for a total dollars spent, then searches a worksheet of customer orders to sift out customers whose total dollars spent are greater than the amount specified by the user.
The overspent customer accounts get displayed on a new worksheet called Report.

This program can perform user input validation, can sort data on a worksheet based on attributes such as date, and can total the customers' spendings if there is more than one spending entry per customer.
