A VBA module that prompts the spreadsheet user for a total amount spent, then searches a worksheet of customer orders to report those customers whose total dollars spent are greater than the amount specififed by the user.
The overspent customer accounts get displayed on a new worksheet called Report.

This program can perform input validation, can sort data on a worksheet based on attributes such as date, and can total the customers' spendings if there is more than one entry per customer.
